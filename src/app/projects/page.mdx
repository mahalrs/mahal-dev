Opinion summarization is a challenging task as it requires the model to understand the sentiment of the input documents to identify the key information. However, due to the high cost of annotating data, there is a lack of large summary datasets for supervised models. This project explores different approaches to generate high-quality synthetic datasets for opinion summarization.

This project combines Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) for image encoding and Sequential Recommendation with BART for processing user interactions and product attributes. This approach uses both content-based and collaborative filtering, leveraging LLMs to capture complex relationships between product attributes and user preferences, while utilizing product images to enhance understanding of product features and aesthetics.
